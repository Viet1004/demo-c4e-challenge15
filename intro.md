# Welcome to the demo Jupyter Book for challenge 15 - Code4Earth 2025

This is a small sample book to give a demo structure of how the project might be.

In the markdown file, we present the proposal for the project

In the jupyter notebook file, we demonstrate an example of how to querying data with a specific set of parameters. The demonstration follows by data exploration and visualization.

In the final step, we try to implement some methods in the framwork of extreme value theory (incomplete).
